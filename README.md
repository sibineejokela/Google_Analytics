## Wedding Photography Site - Google Analytics

This repository contains slides exploring Google Analytics for 6 months (Feb 2020 - July 2020). This resource acts as a guide to provide insights and recommendations for the business moving forward as well as a template for how to access the discussed content.

The information was delivered as a presentation and discussion.
To see all slides at one time, click on **All_Slides_Images.md** above. To download individual slides, look in the **Slide_Images** folder and to download the entire presentation, select **Google_Analytics_ZJPhotography.pptx**.

Reminders: 
* Paths within Google Analytics are displayed in the Powerpoint using a HEADER -> *Subheader* -> Title format 
   * For example: AUDIENCE -> *Demographics* -> Age [see Slide 3]
* Although the exact numbers are now outdated, reach out if you want higher quality images
* A summary of recommendations for each section is available, and after implementing these actions, I can help with Events and Goals when the business is ready for that step
